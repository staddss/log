ff_debug
Usage: ff_debug [<tag_expression>] [--level <level>] [--persist]
       ff_debug --help
       ff_debug --reset
       ff_debug --list_valid_tags

  ff_debug adds and removes debug tags for flimflam.
  Current debug settings are displayed if no parameters are provided

  <tag_expression> is defined in boolean notation using <debug_tag> separated
    by an operator [+-], where + and - imply adding and removing of the tag immediately
    following the operator. An expression beginning with either operators [+-]
    takes the existing tags and modifies them appropriately.  Otherwise, the existing tags
    are replaced by those specified in the command.

    <debug_tag> can be listed using the --list_valid_tags

    e.g.: ff_debug network+wifi
      Sets debug tags to network and wifi
    e.g.: ff_debug +network-service
      Adds network and removes service tags from the existing debug settings

  --list_valid_tags : Displays all valid tags

  --level : Displays or sets current debug level for logging
    All messages at, or above, the current log level are logged. Normal log
    levels range from 4 (LOG_FATAL) to 0 (LOG_INFO). In addition VERBOSE log
    levels are available starting at -1.

    e.g.: ff_debug --level 4
      Logs only FATAL messages.
    e.g.: ff_debug --level 0
      Logs INFO, WARNING, ERROR, ERROR_REPORT, and FATAL messages.
    e.g.: ff_debug --level -4
      Logs everything that "--level 0" does, plus SLOG(<tag>, <n>) messages,
      where <tag> has been enabled for logging, and <n> <= 4. (NOTE: you must
      negate SLOG levels for use with ff_debug. In this example, SLOG(<tag>, 4)
      maps to "--level -4".)

  --reset : Removes all tagging and persistent debug configuration (if any) and
    restores default log level

  --persist : Stores the current debug configuration so that it is
    reused after restart.

  --help : Displays this output

force_activate_fips
  Force activate FIPS mode for the built-in security key.

  gesture properties D-Bus service" flag must be enabled for this command to
  work.

  For more details, see:
  https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/gestures/+/HEAD/docs/gesture_properties.md

  Subcommands:
    devices, devs:
      List the devices managed by the gestures library, with their numeric IDs.

    list <device ID>:
      List the properties for the device with the given ID.

    get <device ID> <property name>:
      Get the current value of a property. Property names containing spaces
      should be quoted. For example:
      $ gesture_prop get 12 "Mouse CPI"

    set <device ID> <property name> <value>:
      Set the value of a property. Values use the same syntax as dbus-send
      (https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-send.1.html#description), and
      should either be arrays or strings. For example:
      $ gesture_prop set 12 "Mouse CPI" array:double:500
      $ gesture_prop set 12 "Log Path" string:/tmp/foo.txt

  This channel may not always boot reliably or have a functioning auto update
  mechanism. Do not do this unless you are prepared to recover your ChromeOS
  device, please be familiar with this article first:
  https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1080595

p2p_update [enable|disable] [--num-connections] [--show-peers]  
  Enables or disables the peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing of updates over the local
  network. This will both attempt to get updates from other peers in the
  network and share the downloaded updates with them. Run this command without
  arguments to see the current state.  Additional switches will display number
  of connections and P2P peers.

Start packet capture.  Start a device-based capture on <device>,
  or do an over-the-air capture on <frequency> with an optionally
  provided HT channel location or VHT channel width.  An over-the-air
  capture can also be initiated using the channel parameters of a
  currently connected <monitored_device>.  Note that over-the-air
  captures are not available with all 802.11 devices. Set <max_size>
  to stop the packet capture if the output .pcap file size exceedes this
  limit. Only device-based capture options (--device and --max-size) are
  available in verified mode. Switch to developer mode to use other
  options.
ping [-4] [-6] [-c count] [-i interval] [-n] [-s packetsize] [-W waittime] <destination>

swap [ enable <size (MB)> | disable | start | stop | status ]  
  Change kernel memory manager parameters
  (FOR EXPERIMENTS ONLY --- USE AT OWN RISK)

  "swap status" (also "swap" with no arguments) shows the values of various
  memory manager parameters and related statistics.

  The enable/disable options enable or disable compressed swap (zram)
  persistently across reboots, and take effect at the next boot.  The enable
  option takes the size of the swap area (in megabytes before compression).
  If the size is omitted, the factory default is chosen.

  The start/stop options turn swap on/off immediately, but leave the settings
  alone, so that the original behavior is restored at the next boot.

  WARNING: if swap is in use, turning it off can cause the system to
  temporarily hang while the kernel frees up memory.  This can take
  a long time to finish.

sync
  Synchronize cached writes to persistent storage.

syslog <message>
  Logs a message to syslog (the system log daemon).

  This can help mark/flag/label the logs just before & after running a different
  operation so you can locate the relevant errors faster.

systrace [<start | stop | status>]  
  Start/stop system tracing.  Turning tracing off will generate a trace
  log file in the Downloads directory with all the events collected
  since the last time tracing was enabled.  One can control the events
  collected by specifying categories after "start"; e.g. "start gfx"
  will collect only graphics-related system events.  "systrace status"
  (or just "systrace") will display the current state of tracing, including
  the set of events being traced.

time_info   
  Returns the current synchronization state for the time service.

top
  Run top.  This will tell you what resources are currently being used and low
  level system processes.

  Users should use the Chrome Task Monitor: press Search+Escape to open it.

wireguard wireguard <cmd> [<args>]

Available subcommands:

list
    Show all configured WireGuard services.
show <name>
    Show the WireGuard service with name <name>.
new <name>
    Create a new WireGuard service with name <name>.
del <name>
    Delete the configured WireGuard service with name <name>.
set <name> [local-ip <ip1>[,<ip2>]] [private-key] [mtu <mtu>] [dns <ip1>[,<ip2>]...]
           [peer <base64-public-key> [remove]

                                     [persistent-keepalive <interval seconds>] ]...
    Configure properties for the WireGuard service with name <name>. Most options should
    have the same meaning and usage as in `wireguard-tools` (and `wg-quick`). Exceptions
    are:
    - At most one IPv4 address and one IPv6 address is supported for `local-ip`.
    - If `dns` is not set, it will be defaulted to "8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4".
    - If `mtu` is not set, it will be determined automatically. Set it to 0 to reset the
      existing value.
    - `endpoint` must be set before using `connect` command.
    - `private-key` and `preshared-key` take no parameters. If they are used, this command
      will prompt you to change the key (or remove the key) via stdin, to avoid leaving
      them in the history of shell.
    Note: If there is no IPv6 configuration (in ip, dns, or allowed-ips), IPv6 will be
    blocked if the shortest prefix length in allowed-ips is less than 8.
connect <name>
    Connect to the configured WireGuard service with name <name>.
disconnect <name>
    Disconnect from the configured WireGuard service with name <name>.
